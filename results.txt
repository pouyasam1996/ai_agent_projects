\textbf{Problem Analysis}

The problem is a coding problem titled "Add Two Numbers." It involves adding two numbers represented by linked lists. Each node contains a single digit, and the digits are stored in reverse order. The task is to add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

\textbf{Solution 1 (Common Approach)}

\textit{Language: Python}

\begin{verbatim}
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def addTwoNumbers(l1, l2):
    dummy = ListNode()
    current = dummy
    carry = 0

    while l1 or l2 or carry:
        val1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
        val2 = l2.val if l2 else 0
        total = val1 + val2 + carry
        carry = total // 10
        current.next = ListNode(total % 10)
        current = current.next

        if l1:
            l1 = l1.next
        if l2:
            l2 = l2.next

    return dummy.next
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Solution 2 (Alternative Approach)}

\textit{Language: Python}

\begin{verbatim}
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def addTwoNumbers(l1, l2):
    stack1, stack2 = [], []

    while l1:
        stack1.append(l1.val)
        l1 = l1.next
    while l2:
        stack2.append(l2.val)
        l2 = l2.next

    carry = 0
    prev = None

    while stack1 or stack2 or carry:
        val1 = stack1.pop() if stack1 else 0
        val2 = stack2.pop() if stack2 else 0
        total = val1 + val2 + carry
        carry = total // 10
        current = ListNode(total % 10)
        current.next = prev
        prev = current

    return prev
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Explanations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Solution 1:} This approach uses a dummy node to simplify handling the head of the result list. It iterates through both linked lists, adding corresponding digits and managing the carry. The time complexity is \(O(\max(n, m))\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the lengths of the two lists. The space complexity is \(O(\max(n, m))\) due to the result list.

    \item \textbf{Solution 2:} This approach uses stacks to reverse the order of the digits, allowing addition from the least significant digit. It constructs the result list in reverse order and then reverses it at the end. The time complexity is \(O(n + m)\), and the space complexity is \(O(n + m)\) due to the stacks.
\end{itemize}
