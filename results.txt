\section*{Coding Problem Analysis and Solutions}

\subsection*{1. PROBLEM ANALYSIS}
The screenshot contains a coding problem involving object-oriented programming in Python. The task is to implement classes for different types of vehicles (ElectricCar and GasCar), each with their own attributes and methods, and demonstrate how they would be used. The code involves inheritance, method overriding, and encapsulation.

\subsection*{2. SOLUTION DESCRIPTION (Common Approach)}
A common approach is to use class inheritance where a base class (\texttt{Car}) defines common attributes and methods, and subclasses (\texttt{ElectricCar} and \texttt{GasCar}) extend or override these to provide specific functionality. This leverages code reuse and clear structure.

\subsection*{3. SOLUTION 1 (Common Approach)}
\begin{verbatim}
class Car:
    def __init__(self, model, year, odometer):
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.odometer = odometer

    def get_car_info(self):
        return f"{self.year} {self.model}, Odometer: {self.odometer} km"

class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, model, year, odometer, battery_size):
        super().__init__(model, year, odometer)
        self.battery_size = battery_size

    def get_car_info(self):
        base_info = super().get_car_info()
        return f"{base_info}, Battery: {self.battery_size} kWh"

class GasCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, model, year, odometer, fuel_tank):
        super().__init__(model, year, odometer)
        self.fuel_tank = fuel_tank

    def get_car_info(self):
        base_info = super().get_car_info()
        return f"{base_info}, Fuel Tank: {self.fuel_tank} L"

# Example usage
tesla = ElectricCar("Model 3", 2020, 15000, 75)
print(tesla.get_car_info())

toyota = GasCar("Corolla", 2018, 40000, 50)
print(toyota.get_car_info())
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{4. SOLUTION DESCRIPTION (Alternative Approach)}
An alternative approach is to use composition instead of inheritance, where each car class contains a reference to a separate component class (e.g., Battery or FuelTank), encapsulating the specific details.

\subsection*{5. SOLUTION 2 (Alternative Approach)}
\begin{verbatim}
class Battery:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size

class FuelTank:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity

class Car:
    def __init__(self, model, year, odometer):
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.odometer = odometer

    def get_car_info(self):
        return f"{self.year} {self.model}, Odometer: {self.odometer} km"

class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, model, year, odometer, battery_size):
        super().__init__(model, year, odometer)
        self.battery = Battery(battery_size)

    def get_car_info(self):
        base_info = super().get_car_info()
        return f"{base_info}, Battery: {self.battery.size} kWh"

class GasCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, model, year, odometer, fuel_capacity):
        super().__init__(model, year, odometer)
        self.fuel_tank = FuelTank(fuel_capacity)

    def get_car_info(self):
        base_info = super().get_car_info()
        return f"{base_info}, Fuel Tank: {self.fuel_tank.capacity} L"

# Example usage
tesla = ElectricCar("Model 3", 2020, 15000, 75)
print(tesla.get_car_info())

toyota = GasCar("Corolla", 2018, 40000, 50)
print(toyota.get_car_info())
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{6. EXPLANATIONS}
\textbf{Solution 1} uses inheritance to share common logic and override methods for specific behavior. This is straightforward and leverages Python's OOP features. \textbf{Time complexity} for method calls is $O(1)$; \textbf{space complexity} is $O(1)$ per object.

\textbf{Solution 2} uses composition, which is more flexible if the battery or fuel tank logic becomes complex or needs to be reused elsewhere. It also keeps the car classes simpler. \textbf{Time and space complexity} are similar to Solution 1.

Both approaches are valid; inheritance is more direct for simple hierarchies, while composition is preferred for more complex or changing requirements.
