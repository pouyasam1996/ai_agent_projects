\section*{Coding Problem Analysis and Solutions}

\subsection*{1. PROBLEM ANALYSIS}
The screenshot shows a classic coding problem: \textbf{Add Two Numbers} (LeetCode Problem 2). 
Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers (with digits stored in reverse order), the task is to add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list, also in reverse order.

\subsection*{2. SOLUTION DESCRIPTION (Common Approach)}
The most common approach is to simulate the addition digit by digit, just like how you would add two numbers by hand, carrying over when the sum exceeds 9. You traverse both linked lists simultaneously, adding corresponding digits and the carry from the previous step, and create new nodes for the result.

\subsection*{3. SOLUTION 1 (Common Approach)}
\begin{verbatim}
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy
        carry = 0

        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            val1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            val2 = l2.val if l2 else 0
            total = val1 + val2 + carry
            carry = total // 10
            current.next = ListNode(total % 10)
            current = current.next

            if l1:
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2:
                l2 = l2.next

        return dummy.next
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{4. SOLUTION DESCRIPTION (Alternative Approach)}
An alternative approach is to first convert the linked lists to integers, perform the addition, and then convert the result back to a linked list. This is less efficient in terms of space and may not handle very large numbers as gracefully, but it is straightforward.

\subsection*{5. SOLUTION 2 (Alternative Approach)}
\begin{verbatim}
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        def toInt(node):
            num = 0
            place = 1
            while node:
                num += node.val * place
                place *= 10
                node = node.next
            return num

        num1 = toInt(l1)
        num2 = toInt(l2)
        total = num1 + num2

        dummy = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy
        if total == 0:
            return dummy
        while total > 0:
            current.next = ListNode(total % 10)
            current = current.next
            total //= 10
        return dummy.next
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{6. EXPLANATIONS}
\textbf{Solution 1:} This approach iterates through both linked lists, adding corresponding digits and managing the carry. It is efficient, with time complexity $O(\max(m, n))$ and space complexity $O(\max(m, n))$, where $m$ and $n$ are the lengths of the input lists.

\textbf{Solution 2:} This approach converts the lists to integers, adds them, and then converts the sum back to a linked list. The time complexity is also $O(\max(m, n))$, but it uses extra space for the integer conversion and may not be suitable for very large numbers due to integer overflow in some languages.

\textbf{Why these approaches?}
- The first is the standard, interview-friendly solution that works for arbitrarily large numbers.
- The second is a more direct, but less robust, method that leverages Python's big integer support.

\textbf{Summary:} Both solutions solve the problem, but the first is preferred for robustness and scalability.
