Coding problem (algorithm, data structure, debugging, etc.)

\textbf{1. PROBLEM ANALYSIS} \\
The problem is asking to determine the maximum profit that can be achieved from a list of stock prices by choosing a single day to buy and a different day in the future to sell. The goal is to find the maximum difference between a pair of prices where the selling price comes after the buying price.

\textbf{2. SOLUTION DESCRIPTION (Common Approach)} \\
A common approach to solve this problem is to use a single pass algorithm that keeps track of the minimum price encountered so far and calculates the potential profit at each step. This approach is efficient because it only requires one traversal of the list, making it optimal for time complexity.

\textbf{3. SOLUTION 1 (Common Approach)} \\
\begin{verbatim}
def maxProfit(prices):
    min_price = float('inf')
    max_profit = 0
    
    for price in prices:
        # Update the minimum price if the current price is lower
        if price < min_price:
            min_price = price
        # Calculate the profit if selling at the current price
        elif price - min_price > max_profit:
            max_profit = price - min_price
    
    return max_profit
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{4. SOLUTION DESCRIPTION (Alternative Approach)} \\
An alternative approach is to use a brute force method where every possible pair of buy and sell days is considered. This approach is less efficient but straightforward, as it checks all combinations to find the maximum profit.

\textbf{5. SOLUTION 2 (Alternative Approach)} \\
\begin{verbatim}
def maxProfitBruteForce(prices):
    max_profit = 0
    n = len(prices)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Calculate the profit for each pair
            profit = prices[j] - prices[i]
            # Update the maximum profit
            if profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = profit
    
    return max_profit
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{6. EXPLANATIONS} \\
\textbf{Solution 1 Explanation:} \\
The first solution iterates through the list of prices while maintaining the minimum price seen so far. For each price, it calculates the potential profit by subtracting the minimum price from the current price. If this profit is greater than the current maximum profit, it updates the maximum profit. This solution has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and a space complexity of \(O(1)\).

\textbf{Solution 2 Explanation:} \\
The second solution uses a nested loop to consider every possible pair of buy and sell days. It calculates the profit for each pair and updates the maximum profit if the current profit is greater. This solution has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) and a space complexity of \(O(1)\). It is less efficient but demonstrates a straightforward approach to solving the problem.

Both solutions aim to find the maximum profit, but the first solution is more efficient and suitable for larger datasets.
